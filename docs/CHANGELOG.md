## 2026-07-11 — Chapter 3 legacy-profile adapter and canonical backend route

### Summary

Added `toConsentProfileVersion` to `@litmo/domain`, a documented adapter (`docs/adr/0002-legacy-profile-adapter.md`) mapping Chapter 2's persisted `TouchLanguageProfile`/`ConsentPreference` shapes onto the canonical Chapter 3 `ConsentProfileVersion`. Added `POST /api/consent/compatibility` in the Express backend, built on the adapter and the canonical engine, and marked the legacy `/api/consent/overlap` POC route deprecated (`Deprecation: true` response header) rather than removing it outright.

### User-visible impact

None yet. No mobile screen calls the new route in this slice.

### Developer impact

`@litmo/domain` exports `toConsentProfileVersion`; shared tests increased to 46. The backend now depends on `@litmo/domain` and runs under `--experimental-strip-types` (`start`, `dev`, `test` scripts updated) to import the shared TypeScript source directly, matching the existing app/shared pattern. Backend tests increased from 6 to 8. Manually verified end-to-end with a live `POST /api/consent/compatibility` request against a running server.

### Migration and setup impact

No database migration. Backend `npm install` picks up the new `@litmo/domain` workspace dependency (already present as a symlink via the existing workspace).

## 2026-07-11 — Chapter 3 practical-effect preview

### Summary

Added `previewProfileChange` to `@litmo/domain`, a pure diff between a not-yet-saved profile version and the currently saved version, both evaluated against the same counterpart profile. Satisfies the Chapter 3 "Versioned profiles" requirement that users can preview the practical effect of a change before saving.

### User-visible impact

None yet. No mobile screen calls this function in this slice; it is available for the profile-edit flow to adopt.

### Developer impact

`@litmo/domain` exports `previewProfileChange` and `ProfileChangePreview`. It never persists a version and never sets `consentGranted`. Shared tests increased to 40.

### Migration and setup impact

None.

## 2026-07-11 — Chapter 3 consent engine property-based coverage

### Summary

Added a seeded, randomized property test proving that restricting any consent rule (stricter state, or revoking receive/offer capability) can never broaden the computed permitted or ask-first overlap, closing the remaining `docs/roadmap/CHAPTER_3_CONSENT_ENGINE.md` testing requirement.

### User-visible impact

None. Domain test coverage only.

### Developer impact

`@litmo/domain` shared tests increased from 35 to 36; the new test runs 200 seeded iterations internally. No production code changed.

### Migration and setup impact

None.

## 2026-07-11 — Chapter 3 consent engine started

### Summary

Added the canonical directional, version-aware consent engine and session snapshot semantics in `@litmo/domain`.

### User-visible impact

No mobile screen changes yet. Future compatibility views can distinguish welcomed, ask-first, and excluded options without exposing private notes.

### Developer impact

The domain package now exports runtime schemas, deterministic overlap computation, privacy-safe explanations, exact-version snapshots, explicit confirmation, material-change invalidation, and withdrawal behavior. Shared tests increased to 35.

### Migration and setup impact

No database migration or environment change in this slice.
